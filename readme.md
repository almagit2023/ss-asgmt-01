# Designing a Responsive Grid System: Understanding Columns and Gutters

When designing a grid system for a responsive layout, the concepts of column width, gutter width, and total available space play a crucial role. Here, weâ€™ll break down the process of creating a flexible grid system that can scale beautifully across devices.

## Key Principles:

1. **Viewport Independence**
   We will work with percentages and relative units to ensure our grid adapts to any device width. For simplicity, we treat the total available width of the viewport as **100%**, regardless of the device size.

2. **Columns and Gutters**

   - We define a grid with **12 columns**, where each column has a fixed width of **75px**.
   - Horizontal gutters, or the spacing between columns, are set to **32px**.

3. **The Last Gutter**
   When gutters are applied in a grid, an additional (12th) gutter is automatically added after the rightmost column. This means the last gutter sits outside the visible content area. To calculate the total content area, this rightmost gutter must be subtracted from the total available width.

## The Total Content Area:

The total content area, excluding the rightmost gutter, is calculated as:

```css
Content Area Width = 100% - Rightmost Gutter
```
